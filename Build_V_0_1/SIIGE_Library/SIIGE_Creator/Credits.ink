===credits_SIIGE===

This tool and all subsequent files were created from the basis of the Inky software, developed by Inklestudios.
I have learned through other creators and had help from the Ink Discord on some occasion and I want to thank those people dearly.
Also a big thank you to anyone who has helped test this tool and gave pointers on what to do better etc.
The SIIGE was developed by Treraer. Reachable via Twitter <a href="twitter.com/treraer">Treraer's Twitter</a>, Discord discord.gg/WJzAHgv (paste this into the address bar) or sometimes even Twitch <a href="twitch.tv/treraer">Treraer's Twitch</a>
