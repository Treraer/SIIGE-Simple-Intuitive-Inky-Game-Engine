# SIIGE - Simple Intuitive Inky Game Engine

This is meant to become the space where the Simple and Intuitive Inky Game Engine (short SIIGE) will be uploaded.
SIIGE was written in Ink by Inklestudios and should only be used with that and/or Unity. (If you get that to work hit me up. I have no idea of Unity.)

SIIGE is meant to be a help to writers like me who don't have a lot of coding knowledge but still want to use certain special features of Ink. I primarily have written this for myself, but in the end I thought I should share it with people if they want to use it. It shares a few system which are customizable with a bit of coding knowledge since I tried to make it as acessible as possible. The current system that are implemented can be found below. Should any section need more documentation or explanation let me know and I will try to explain it in more detail.

# What is already implemented?

* 5x5 Map System
* 5x5 Map System with Fights
* Fighting System
  * EXP System
  * Leveling System
* Inventory System

# Planned Features and those which I am thinking about:

* Implement treasure pool to get items after a treasure has been found on the map
* Split all files, functions, etc. to their own files for better readability?

If empty, suggest something and maybe the brain will be able to compute it.
