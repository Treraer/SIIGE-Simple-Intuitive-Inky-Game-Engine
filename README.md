# SIIGE - Simple Intuitive Inky Game Engine

This is meant to become the space where the Simple and Intuitive Inky Game Engine (short SIIGE) will be uploaded.
SIIGE was written in Ink by Inklestudios and should only be used with that and/or Unity. (If you get that to work hit me up. I have no idea of Unity.)

SIIGE is meant to be a help to writers like me who don't have a lot of coding knowledge but still want to use certain special features of Ink. I primarily have written this for myself, but in the end I thought I should share it with people if they want to use it. It shares a few system which are customizable with a bit of coding knowledge since I tried to make it as acessible as possible. The current system that are implemented can be found below. Should any section need more documentation or explanation let me know and I will try to explain it in more detail.

# Major features

The major features include two things. 

* The Game Engine (through Inky or Ink)
* Interactive Map (through Mapbox)

# The Map

The map is added through Mapbox and is meant to provide players/readers a possibility to track their journey (although still only by hand with no automation)
Currently it holds the fantasy map called Chevillia. I created this one for my own purpose with the Azgaar Generator and QGis but anyone can use it if they want to. You can also create your own maps and implement them into the engine and one day I will write a documentation for it but not today. If you want a basic concept go to this and look at the four videos that are available. (only three are linked there) https://github.com/Azgaar/Fantasy-Map-Generator/wiki/GIS-data-export

# Ink - What is it?

Ink is a sort of scripting language while also being a very effective text editor (sort of). Basically what Ink allows you to do is write stories that have branching outcomes after one or multiple choices. If you ever read a text adventure story you know what it's about. It allows for simple stories with just choices or things like this engine, where you more or less can pre-code a whole game.

In our case Ink provides the backbone of the engine by being the engine itself that controls the story and all the other features that are listed below.

# What is already implemented? (Inky)

* 5x5 Game Map System
* 5x5 Game Map System with Fights
* Fighting System
  * EXP System
  * Leveling System
* Inventory System

# Planned Features and those which I am thinking about (Inky):

* Implement treasure pool to get items after a treasure has been found on the map
* Split all files, functions, etc. to their own files for better readability?

# Wishfull thinking when it comes to features (help appreciated):

* Make the CSS work so the map doesnt get blocked anymore on smaller screens.
* Create a new CSS so the index.html can have different get-ups for example: Fantasy, Sci-fi etc.
* Make the map interact with the story
* Make the layer changer nav also appear on fullscreen
* A playlist so people can also listen to music tracks that would resonate with the story.

If empty, suggest something and maybe the brain will be able to compute it.
